# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Changes Made

THERE was a lot of repeat information in the CSS that I consolidated into one class.
CHANGED the side portion of the site into sideBAR so make it easier to keep track of what that piece of code was controlling.
GROUPED together the footer to clean up the code.
PUT alt tags for all of the images.
MADE all links working to the correct site.
TOOK out digital-marketing-meeting.jpg out of the CSS and moved it to HTML and added alt tag.
